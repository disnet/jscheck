To run JSCheck you will need a working haskell environment. It has been tested
on Haskell 6.10.4 but it probably works on earlier version as well.

To Install:
In the jscheck root directory run:
$ cabal install

(you might need to install dependancies if cabal doesn't do it for you)

Cabal will install jscheck to ~/.cabal/bin.

To run:
$ ~/.cabal/bin/jscheck "<program source>"

To test:
$ ~/.cabal/bin/test-jscheck
